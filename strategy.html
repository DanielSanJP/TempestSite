            <div class="card">
                <h2>Target Audience</h2>
                <p>Our main audience consists of researchers and experts such as astronomers, astrophysicists and
                    planetary
                    scientists who can apply our data and put it to further use.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Collaborating with space agencies such as Rocket Labs, Nasa and other global entities allows us to
                    support their missions using our discoveries. We provide universities and research centres with data
                    for
                    studies and curriculum enhancements facilitating deep explorations and encouraging innovation in
                    future
                    space exploration. Educators such as teachers and professors can utilize our research into their
                    teaching programs to offer students real world applications.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our goal is to motivate and educate the up-coming generation of scientists, engineers and astronauts
                    by
                    preparing them for careers in space exploration. The commercial space sector comprising aerospace
                    companies and launch service providers like Rocket lab, benefit from our research to improve their
                    projects.

                <h2>How will we profit from this? </h2>

                <p>Tempest generates revenue through partnerships with commercial/private space agencies, governments,
                    universities and research institutes through selling our specialized research, designs and
                    innovative technology. Tempest has established partnerships with industry leaders like SpaceX, NASA,
                    and Blue Origin where we directly offer specialized research findings and innovative, supporting
                    their space missions and technology advancements. These collaborations are structured as contractual
                    agreements, ensuring a steady flow of revenue through projects and deliveries.</p>

                <p>
                    Tempest has also developed partnerships with the governmental space agencies that allows us to
                    contribute to both national and international space exploration projects, while being funded through
                    the formal agreements. Tempest also has a hand in preparing future astronauts with our cutting-edge
                    mission simulation technology. By providing these technologies as a service, we generate revenue
                    through training contracts and simulation service fees.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Tempest also collaborates with universities and research institutes. Universities and research
                    institutions have become ever more interested in utilizing advanced robotics for teaching and
                    researching purposes. By collaborating with these institutions, we generate revenue while we
                    contribute to advancing current research and studies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By diversifying our revenue streams and focusing on both immediate sales and long-term partnerships,
                    Tempest is set to achieve strong financial growth. This strategy not only secures our position in
                    the market but also ensures that we have the financial resources we need to continue innovating and
                    leading in the field of space exploration robotics.

                <h2>Scope</h2>

                <h3>Scope Included</h3>
                <p>The scope of our project consists of the comprehensive design and fabrication of the satellite,
                    ensuring it is capable of housing all our necessary equipment and withstanding the harsh conditions
                    of launching and orbiting space. Our technical team will integrate a range of advanced equipment,
                    including visual spectrum cameras, infrared cameras, ultraviolet cameras, magnetometers, metal
                    detectors, gravimeters, light intensity sensors, and radio spectrum detection devices. Additionally,
                    we will implement a propulsion system that utilizes interactions between orthogonal electric fields,
                    along with a Radio Thermal Generator (RTG) and solar panel arrays for power generation, and a
                    battery bank for energy storage.</p>
                <p>
                    The project encompasses the development and execution of extensive testing protocols to validate the
                    performance and reliability of both hardware and software components under simulated space
                    conditions. Our software team will develop and run computational models and simulations to support
                    technical and systems analysis. The team assigned to this project includes a Technical Manager with
                    five staff members, a Software Manager with five staff members, an Engineering Manager with nine
                    staff members, and a Telemetry Manager with two staff members, all contributing their specialized
                    skills to ensure the success of the mission.</p>

                <h3>Scope Excluded</h3>
                <p>This project does not include the development or manufacturing of the launch vehicle(rocket), which
                    will be provided by Rocket Lab. Rocket Lab will manage the launch operations, including the
                    logistics and integration of the satellite into the rocket, with our team providing support as
                    needed. Additionally, the creation or maintenance of satellite communications systems, such as
                    ground-based satellite dishes and the necessary fibre optic network for data transmission, will be
                    handled by Rocket Lab and its network.</p>
                <p>
                    Legal authority to operate space vehicles and secure necessary governmental approvals will be
                    managed by the New Zealand Space Agency and Rocket Lab, with our involvement limited to the
                    application process. The transportation of the satellite to the launch site will be conducted by a
                    reliable transportation company, separate from our operations.</p>
